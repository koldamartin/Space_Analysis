# Space_Analysis
This is a data analysis project of Space missions.
I used several libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
The original assignment and the dataset is from the Udemy Course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
The analysis was made in JetBrains Datalore.
